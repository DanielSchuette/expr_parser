# Expression Parser in Rust

## Overview
An example of a simple program that takes expressions like `5 + 8 * (7-1)` and parses them into a syntax tree. [GRAMMAR.md](./GRAMMAR.md) explains the process in greater detail. A few things will be implemented like executing the syntax tree that lexer and parser create. This is really just an experiment to see how a context-free grammar-based parser might be implemented in `Rust`.
